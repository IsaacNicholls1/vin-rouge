# The Arcade

This Website was built by Isaac Nicholls for Code Institute Final project for the 16 week Bootcamp - Full Stack Development for the AI Augmented Developer. The brief for the project was a full interactive website, with bpth front and back end server, using the Django/Python framework. Full CRUD funbtionality was required. After some research and brainstorming/mindmapping I had idea of a wine review website, specifically for French wines. This is something that interests me, and after living in France for 10 years it is something i have a passion and knowledge for. This helped to design the site, and create user stories and my project board.   

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Here is an example of this website and its homepage ![Am I Responsive]()

# Agile Methodology

## Agile 
- Agile methodology is "a set of methods and practices where solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organising, cross-functional teams"
- A project board was set-up to keep track of user stories. Each user story was assigned a 'MoSCoW' prioritisation (must have, should have, could have, won't have) tag. 

## GitHub project planning
- I used a GitHub project board to assist me in planning and carrying out tasks related to my user stories. This approach allowed me to enter all user stories into the project board, where they could be easily assigned and labeled. The GitHub project board provided a clear overview of the tasks, helping me to prioritize, organize, and track progress efficiently, ensuring that all user stories were addressed systematically and effectively. 

The board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/IsaacNicholls1/projects/12).

## MOSCOW Prioritisation 

- In order to effectively utilise the MoSCoW prioritization method, I ensured that my project issues board in GitHub was actively used. This provided a comprehensive overview of the issues related to my user stories, allowing me to categorize and track them efficiently. The GitHub issues board enabled me to organise tasks, monitor progress, and verify completion, ensuring that I addressed our Must-Haves, Should-Haves, Could-Haves, and Won't-Haves systematically and effectively.

 ## Design
 
 ##  Colour Scheme

 - I selected a palette that balances elegance and approachability, reflecting the sophistication of French wines and the inviting nature of Vin Rouge. Pastel green offers a fresh, soothing backdrop that complements the rich, deep hues of wine colors like merlot and burgundy. Light gray adds a modern, clean touch, ensuring the overall design is sleek and visually appealing, enhancing the user's experience while exploring wine reviews.


 - Inspired by https://coolors.co/16084a-141414-eef0f2-ffa90a-c270b0

 **Coolers**
![Colours](/assets/images/rdme-image/coolercolorscheme.png)
 
 ##  Fonts
 -  I chose Libre Baskerville as my font, as it was a common font used on other wine sites, and also used on many wine bottles. It also has good readability. 

 ![Font](/assets/images/rdme-image/googlefont.png)
 
 ## Wireframes

 - Wireframes were created with Balsamiq to create clear, visual layouts of the site's design. It helped in identifying potential issues and refining the user interface early on, ensuring a more seamless user experience.
 - The wireframes were developed at the start of the project and then worked on as I went through, to tweak the changes I made to the design and feel of the site
 - They differ slightly to the exact look of the site as In decided to use different images and styles to the wire frame ideas.

## Known Bugs


### Bugs

- Out footer text was not wanting to line up and be the same as the rest on the font for the pages. This had to be fixed and debugged. 

### Poor Font for User

- We felt that the font had to be just right for the website feel and the user, and after some testing we found the perfect one which was not our first option.  


## During development and testing, these are the current bugs:

### Images  

- Some of the images are still too large - generating a lower lighthouse score than we would have liked. 

### Unknown code fixes in lighthouse

- I have identified some errors and warnings in Lighthouse that could enhance the score. To address these, I will conduct thorough research before my next project to understand and resolve the issues. This proactive approach will help ensure my site meets high performance standards.

### Responsiveness

- Responsiveness issues were encountered with the games pages - we would have liked to implement and test these further but ran out of time. 
- With more time this could have been tested further, the games were responsive but not all the way and with every device. We would have liked to test and implement these better, for enhanced UX.

# Use of AI #




## Co-Pilot

- Throughout this project, I extensively utilised Copilot to enhance development and streamline testing. As this was my first experience with AI tools on such a scale, I found Copilot to be an invaluable collaborator throughout the entire process.
- Using Copilot throughout this project has been invaluable in several ways. Copilot has provided detailed, step-by-step guidance, which has been crucial in resolving technical issues related to Django migrations and database schema.
- It has also offered design feedback, helping to ensure that the review form on the wine detail page is both user-friendly and visually appealing.


## Code Creation & other uses

-By utilising question-and-answer prompts and multi-step instructions, I was able to generate a good initial draft for my test cases. I could then refine these to better match the project's requirements. 

- The iterative back-and-forth with Copilot felt like having a knowledgeable pair programmer by my side. This collaboration made me more thoughtful about how I structured my prompts, as clearer questions led to better answers.

- Throughout the project's development, Copilot also served as an invaluable debugging and problem-solving tool. Whether I encountered specific error messages or stumbled upon unexpected issues, Copilot provided insightful suggestions that greatly expedited the troubleshooting process. Its ability to offer solutions, based on context, helped me overcome roadblocks efficiently, saving me both time and effort.

- Copilot significantly contributed to the development of my site's front end by providing efficient code suggestions and auto-completions, which streamlined the implementation of interactive features and responsive design elements.

- Copilot's ability to generate ideas and offer alternative solutions has fostered continuous improvement, making the development process more efficient and effective. Overall, Copilot's support has significantly contributed to the project's success by enhancing both the technical and user experience aspects.
- I found it very useful overall and saved me a great deal of time, however I found when using it, it needed a close eye kept on it as it sometimes adds in extra closing tags and code that is sometimes not needed.
